# Dead-by-Daylight-Clone

A clone of a popular game called "Dead by Daylight". One of my games where I experiemented with 3D graphics (very cool looking).
In total it has a few thousand lines of code.
This game is multiplayer online and MUST have minimum two players in order to play. 

In this game, a "killer" chases down the survivors and stops them from escaping. I used Three.js.

The game can be found hosted at this link: https://fead-by-faylight.herokuapp.com/

Controls - 

WASD to move, mouse to look, and spacebar to interact with objects.
