-***FIXED SERVER CRASH BUG (on last survivor fatal hit) THANKS HEROKU LOGGING***
-added skill check messages (and ones that say dont HOLD space...)
-fixed gen progress bug (on damage goes to 0% glitch)  (thanks for your help aidan...)

-fixed minor bug related to attacking as killer (frame = 1 set twice by client then by server message...)
-generator damage animation is no longer local, and its been revamped (and you cant spam start it during animation anymore)
-fixed 3rd person camera (no longer goes through walls)
-fixed collision displacement... still not continuous (that improved, but still has bugs so its a no go for now)
-generally updated map step by step...

-changed "engine" to latest version (was 1-2 years outdated)
-revive time for survivors was halved (20s --> 10s)
-made vaulting time based instead of frame based
-no step sounds from gamemode 1 players... (already planned for this... but gamemode was "gameMode" so it didnt work)
-cont collision added (1 extra raycast to avoid almost all wall phasing)
-target fps set to 60 (and added setFps function for... debug?)
-fixed downed rotation glitch
-added shadows to the game (looks real nice, until a gen goes off and THREE.js shadowmap limitation is revealed...)
-added hammer and pekka sword weapons which serve no purpose except aesthetic (well pekka glows and gives you away easier...)
-step sound range significantly reduced.
-discon message doesnt appear on connect.
